# üìå What are Hints and Why ScyllaDB Does Not Support Them

## What are Hints in Apache Cassandra?

**Hints** are a temporary mechanism used in Cassandra to help maintain **eventual consistency** during node outages.

### üîß How Hints Work

- If a node is **down**, other nodes store a **hint** (a record of the write).
- When the downed node comes back up, those hints are **replayed** to it.
- This process is known as **Hinted Handoff**.

### Benefits in Cassandra

- Avoids immediate consistency issues during temporary node failures.
- Helps maintain data availability and consistency.

## ‚ùå Why ScyllaDB Does Not Support Hints

### 1. üß± Different Philosophy

- Scylla prefers **strict correctness** over temporary patching.
- Avoids masking infrastructure issues (like flapping nodes).

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of Data Corruption

- Hints can lead to **conflicts** if newer writes happen before replay.
- Possible **inconsistencies** if hints are replayed out of order.

### 3. üö® Operational Complexity

- Managing hint replay requires:
  - Additional **storage**
  - Coordinated **hint replay logic**
  - Handling **replay delays** and potential overloads

### 4. üß† Better Alternatives Exist

Scylla uses more robust strategies:

|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Repair (Row-level)**  | Fixes inconsistencies after downtime using efficient repair protocols.   |
| **Quorum Writes**       | Ensures writes reach a majority, reducing need for retries.              |
| **Durable Writes**      | Uses commit logs to avoid data loss.                                     |
| **Monitoring/Gossip**   | Rapid detection and rerouting when nodes go offline.                     |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

ScyllaDB **does not support Hints** because:

- They introduce **complexity**, **risk**, and **operational overhead**.
- Scylla relies on **quorum consistency**, **repair tools**, and **durable writes** for a more **robust and scalable** approach to consistency and failure recovery.
