# SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle:** every part of code should do just one logical task, and if it not, it should break to two different part
2. **Open / Close Principle:** (open for extension, closed for modification) it means that we should be able to add more functionality without changing existing code
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle:** this means that the child class should implement everything in parent class
4. **Interface Segregation Principle:** this means we shouldn't impose the implementation of something if it is not needed
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle:** this principle states that high-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules
