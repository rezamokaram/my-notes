# lsusb, lspci, lsblk, lshw

## lsusb

`lsusb` = list USB.  
It’s a Linux command that shows all USB devices connected to your system (with details like bus, device ID, vendor, and product).

## lspci

`lspci` = list PCI.  
It’s a Linux command that shows all PCI devices in your system (like graphics cards, network cards, sound cards, etc.).

## lsblk

`lsblk` = list block devices.  
It shows storage devices (hard drives, SSDs, partitions) in a tree format, without showing USB or PCI stuff.

### what is block devices

A block device in Linux is any device that stores data in fixed-size blocks and lets you read/write those blocks randomly.

- Examples: hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, partitions.

They’re called block devices because data is handled in chunks (blocks), not as a continuous stream (like with character devices e.g. keyboard, mouse).

- Block devices → store data in blocks, support random access (e.g., HDD, SSD, USB drive).

- Character devices → handle data as a stream, sequential access only (e.g., keyboard, mouse, serial port).

To show:  

```bash
# block devices
ls -l /dev | grep "^b"
# or
lsblk

# character devices
ls -l /dev | grep "^c"
```

## lshw

`lshw` (List Hardware) is a Linux command that displays detailed information about your computer’s hardware, like CPU, RAM, storage, and network devices.

## loadable kernel modules

- A kernel module is a piece of code that can be loaded into the Linux kernel at runtime.

- This allows you to extend the kernel’s functionality (like adding support for a new device or filesystem) without rebooting.

- Think of it like adding a plugin to your system.

## .ko files

- `.ko` stands for Kernel Object.

- These are the compiled files for kernel modules.

- You load them into the kernel using commands like insmod or modprobe.

- Example:

```terminal
sudo insmod myModule.ko    # Load module
sudo rmmod myModule         # Remove module
```

### lsmod

- lsmod lists all currently loaded kernel modules.

- Useful to check if your module is active.

### modprobe

`modprobe` is a Linux command used to load or remove kernel modules.  
It automatically handles dependencies between modules, unlike insmod which loads a single .ko file without checking dependencies.

```terminal
sudo modprobe <module_name>    # Load a module
sudo modprobe -r <module_name> # Remove a module
```
