## dbus

D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for apps and services to talk to each other.

## proc  (pseudo file system)

This is where the Kernel keeps its settings and properties. This directory is created on ram and files might have write access (say for some hardware configurations). You can find things like:

- IRQs (interrupt requests)
- I/O ports (locations in memory where CPU can talk with devices)
- DMA (direct memory access, faster than I/O ports)
- Processes
- Network Settings
