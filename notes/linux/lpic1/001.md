## hal

HAL stands for Hardware Abstraction Layer.

In Linux (and Unix-like systems), HAL was a daemon (hald) that provided a standard interface for hardware detection and management. It allowed desktop applications and system tools to interact with hardware in a uniform way, regardless of the actual device. ***deprecated‌***
