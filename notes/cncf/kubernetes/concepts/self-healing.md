# Self-Healing and Kubernetes

## What is Self-Healing?

**Self-healing** refers to the ability of a system to automatically detect and recover from faults or failures without human intervention. In software and infrastructure, it means that when something goes wrong—like a crashed service, a failed server, or a misbehaving application—the system can identify the problem and fix it on its own to maintain availability and stability.

## How Does Kubernetes Do Self-Healing?

Kubernetes, the container orchestration platform, has built-in self-healing mechanisms to keep your applications running smoothly. Here’s how it does it:

1. **Pod Monitoring and Restarting:**  
   Kubernetes continuously monitors the state of Pods (the smallest deployable units running your containers). If a Pod crashes or becomes unresponsive, Kubernetes automatically restarts it on the same node or moves it to a healthy node.

2. **Health Checks (Liveness and Readiness Probes):**  
   - **Liveness Probe:** Checks if a container is alive. If this probe fails, Kubernetes kills the container and restarts it.  
   - **Readiness Probe:** Checks if the container is ready to serve traffic. If this fails, Kubernetes stops sending traffic to that Pod until it’s healthy again.

3. **Replica Management:**  
   Kubernetes manages the desired number of Pod replicas. If a Pod goes down or a node fails, Kubernetes automatically creates new Pods to maintain the specified replica count, ensuring continuous availability.

4. **Node Monitoring and Rescheduling:**  
   Kubernetes monitors nodes. If a node fails or becomes unreachable, Kubernetes will reschedule the Pods from that node onto other healthy nodes.

5. **Controllers (like Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet):**  
   These controllers constantly compare the current state with the desired state. If there’s a mismatch (like a missing Pod), they take corrective action to restore the desired state.

## Summary

Kubernetes’ self-healing features help ensure that your applications stay up and running by:

- Restarting failed containers automatically  
- Replacing lost Pods or moving them to healthy nodes  
- Avoiding sending traffic to unhealthy Pods  
- Rescheduling work from failed nodes  

This automation reduces downtime and helps maintain service reliability.
