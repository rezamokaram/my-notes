# RBAC

Role-Based Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used access control mechanism in computer security that defines permissions based on roles that users have within a system. It is a way of managing authorization by grouping users into roles and assigning permissions to those roles. This approach simplifies access management, enhances security, and makes it easier to scale systems.

Here's a detailed explanation of key concepts and components related to Role-Based Access Control:

## Core Components

1. **Roles:**
    - Roles are predefined sets of permissions that define a user's job function or responsibilities. Users are assigned to one or more roles, and the permissions associated with those roles determine what actions the users can perform.
2. **Permissions:**
    - Permissions are rules or policies that define what actions users are allowed or denied within a system. These actions may include read, write, execute, delete, etc. Permissions are associated with roles, and users inherit permissions through their assigned roles.
3. **Users:**
    - Users are individuals who interact with a system. Each user is assigned to one or more roles, and their access rights are determined by the permissions associated with those roles.

## Key Concepts

1. **Role Hierarchy:**
    - In some RBAC systems, roles can be organized in a hierarchical structure. This allows for easier management of roles and permissions. Users inherit permissions not only from their assigned roles but also from roles higher up in the hierarchy.
2. **Permission Assignment:**
    - Permissions are assigned to roles rather than directly to individual users. This makes it easier to manage access control, especially in large systems with many users.
3. **Dynamic Separation of Duties (SoD):**
    - RBAC allows for the dynamic separation of duties, meaning that users can have different roles in different contexts. For example, a user might have an "approver" role in one context and a "submitter" role in another.
4. **Least Privilege Principle:**
    - RBAC aligns with the principle of least privilege, which means that users should have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions. Unnecessary permissions are not granted.

## Implementation

1. **Database Schema:**
    - In a database, roles and permissions are often represented in tables. A users table may have a foreign key that links to a roles table, and roles may have associated permissions.
2. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
    - RBAC can be implemented using access control lists (ACLs) that specify which roles have access to specific resources or perform certain actions. ACLs define the relationships between roles and permissions.
3. **Authorization Checks:**
    - During user authentication, the system checks the roles assigned to the user and determines whether the user has the necessary permissions to perform a requested action.

## Advantages of RBAC

1. **Scalability:**
    - RBAC scales well in large and complex systems, making it easier to manage permissions across a large number of users.
2. **Security:**
    - RBAC enhances security by enforcing the principle of least privilege and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
3. **Simplicity and Manageability:**
    - RBAC simplifies access management and makes it easier to administer and audit.
4. **Flexibility:**
    - RBAC is flexible and allows for the dynamic assignment of roles and permissions based on user responsibilities.

In summary, Role-Based Access Control is a powerful and widely adopted approach for managing access to resources within a system. It provides a structured and scalable method for organizing and controlling user permissions based on their roles and responsibilities.

## How exactly we should asign permissions? [IMPLEMENTATION]

In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), permissions are assigned to users indirectly through the roles to which users are assigned. The process of assigning permissions in RBAC typically involves the following steps:

1. **Define Roles:**
    - Identify the various roles that users may have within the system. Roles should represent job functions, responsibilities, or sets of related tasks. For example, in a content management system, you might have roles like "Admin," "Editor," and "Viewer."
2. **Identify Permissions:**
    - Enumerate the specific permissions or actions that users might need to perform within the system. These can include read, write, delete, execute, or other actions specific to your application. For example, permissions for a document management system might include "Create Document," "Edit Document," and "Delete Document."
3. **Assign Permissions to Roles:**
    - Associate each role with the appropriate set of permissions. This establishes the link between the role and the actions that users with that role are allowed to perform. For example:
        - Admin Role:
            - Create Document
            - Edit Document
            - Delete Document
        - Editor Role:
            - Edit Document
        - Viewer Role:
            - Read Document
4. **Assign Roles to Users:**
    - Users are then assigned one or more roles based on their responsibilities or job functions. The assignment of roles to users is typically done by administrators or through an automated process.
        - User A: Admin Role
        - User B: Editor Role
        - User C: Viewer Role
5. **Permissions Inheritance:**
    - Users inherit permissions through the roles to which they are assigned. If a user has multiple roles, they accumulate the permissions associated with each role. This simplifies the management of access control and reduces the risk of granting unnecessary permissions.
6. **Authorization Checks:**
    - When a user attempts to perform a specific action or access a resource, the system performs an authorization check. It checks whether the user's roles include the necessary permissions for the requested action. If the user has the required permissions, the action is allowed; otherwise, access is denied.

Here's a simple example in pseudo-code to illustrate the concept:

```python
pythonCopy code
# Define roles and associated permissions
admin_role = ["Create Document", "Edit Document", "Delete Document"]
editor_role = ["Edit Document"]
viewer_role = ["Read Document"]

# Assign roles to users
user_a_roles = [admin_role]
user_b_roles = [editor_role]
user_c_roles = [viewer_role]

# Authorization check for a specific action
requested_action = "Edit Document"

# Check if User B has permission to edit a document
if requested_action in user_b_roles:
    print("User B is authorized to", requested_action)
else:
    print("Access denied for User B to", requested_action)

```

In this example, permissions are assigned to roles, roles are assigned to users, and an authorization check is performed based on the user's roles and the requested action. This approach allows for a scalable and flexible access control system.
