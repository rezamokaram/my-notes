# PGO

`Profile guided optimization (PGO)`

also known as

`profile-directed feedback (PDF)`

also known as

`feedback-directed optimization (FDO)`

Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) is a sophisticated optimization technique used in software development to improve program performance by collecting data about its runtime behavior and using that information to inform and guide the optimization process. This technique is typically implemented in the compiler, which uses the collected data to generate more optimized machine code.

## **How PGO Works**

PGO involves several steps, typically executed in a cyclic workflow:

1. **Instrumentation**: Initially, the compiler generates an instrumented version of the application. This version includes additional code to collect runtime data such as function call frequency, loop iteration counts, and branch execution probabilities.
2. **Profiling Run**: This instrumented version of the application is then run on a representative workload or benchmark. It's crucial that this workload accurately reflects the real-world scenarios in which the application will operate to gather useful profiling data. The execution of this instrumented build creates a profile data file that records the critical performance characteristics.
3. **Optimization**: The compiler reads this profile data when compiling the application a second time. It uses the insights gained from the profiling data to optimize the code. For example, it might:
    - Optimize frequently executed paths for better performance (hot paths).
    - Improve branch prediction and layout of basic blocks in memory to reduce mispredictions and cache misses.
    - Place rarely used functions together to reduce their impact on the cache footprint.
    - Inline functions more aggressively based on their runtime usage.
4. **Final Build**: The result is a non-instrumented, optimized version of the application that should run faster than an equivalent version compiled without PGO.

### **Advantages of PGO**

- **Performance Improvement**: Applications compiled with PGO typically run faster and more efficiently because the optimizations are based on actual usage patterns.
- **Dynamic Optimization**: Since PGO optimizations are based on real execution data, they can adapt more effectively to dynamic runtime conditions compared to static analysis alone.

### **Disadvantages of PGO**

- **Complex Workflow**: The process requires generating and running an instrumented build, collecting data, and then re-compiling, which adds complexity to the build process.
- **Profiling Overhead**: Running the instrumented version can significantly slow down the application during the data collection phase.
- **Maintenance of Representative Test Cases**: The effectiveness of PGO depends heavily on the representativeness of the profiling workload. Keeping these test cases up-to-date with changing application scenarios can be challenging.

### **Usage**

PGO is particularly useful in performance-critical applications such as database engines, operating systems, and large-scale computing applications where even small percentage improvements in speed can lead to significant gains. It's supported by many modern compilers like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), LLVM/Clang, and Microsoft Visual Studio.

In summary, PGO allows developers to optimize their software in a highly targeted way, leveraging actual program execution data to make informed decisions about where and how to optimize the code. This makes it an invaluable tool in the optimization toolkit for performance-critical software development.
